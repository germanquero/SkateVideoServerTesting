                        WELCOME TO THE SKATE VIDEO SERVER TEST PROGRAM




This is how the skate video Server is ment to be used:

There is a folder in the home directory (content_skatevideoserver)that represents the content aviable on the website.
You can quit, add, rename or whatever you want but changes wont be aplied untill "config" command is executed.
Into the content_skatevideo server you'll several directories, the one that you want to edit is the "videos" one.
The other two are automated by the "config" command.
 

 **rename-file-guide:

 ~It's important to be carefull while renaming folders beacuse the configuration script takes their namesf for generatin a different download and display name.
 ~Don't put any spaces on the file name, if you want the file to apear with an space on the websit put an underscore "_".
 ~Don't put capital Leters, the script will capitalize it for you.
 ~Don't put any dots or any non alfanumeric symbols.



 Example:

 1) Two files are moved to the content_skatevdieoserver/videos/ directory, three files are removed from there, and 4 of them had been renamed.
 2) Client-side: anithing happend to the website.
 3) "config" command has been executed.
 4) New videos apeared, old videos dissapeared and renamed ones apeare with the updatedname. Compressed files has been updated to the lastet listo fo videos.
